# python-challenge

In this repository, you will find two files called pyBank and pyPoll. Each of these files contain a resource folder, analysis folder, and a main.py file.
Resource folder contains the csv file, the analysis folder contains the txt file, and the main.py file contains the python code.

Please note that in order to solve this challenge I have used the following:
